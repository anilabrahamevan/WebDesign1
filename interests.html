            For me, designing is a way of speaking without talking, a method to illustrate motion, an experience to
            create images that connect with the others. Starting at the age of 15, curiosity was that which fueled me,
            the thought that a camera, an instrument which is anything close to a time machine, a machine that captures
            moments from different perspectives. Later on, the possibility of manipulating a scene, using techniques.
            both outside and inside the camera, made possible realities that were dreamlike. <br> <br>

            Walking down the road of designing & photography, appreciation, and obstacles both have been a constant
            motivation for learning and a way to find out my style. As time aged by, I found myself being versatile,
            spontaneous, and confident in my methods and communication. Since then, I've worked with other talented
            artists, photographers, companies, and clients from all over the globe.

            Acting was never part of the plan! But what is. It came by through my journey of photography and the life
            during that. It was something very novel to me yet I enjoyed ever bit of it.
